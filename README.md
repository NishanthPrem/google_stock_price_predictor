Built a stock price prediction model using Python, TensorFlow, and LSTM neural networks. The model predicts future Google stock prices based on historical data, utilizing 60 timesteps for past price analysis. Applied feature scaling, data preprocessing, and reshaped inputs to optimize for LSTM layers. Implemented multiple LSTM layers with dropout regularization to prevent overfitting, and trained the model using mean squared error loss with the Adam optimizer. Visualized real vs. predicted prices using Matplotlib for performance analysis. Demonstrated proficiency in time series forecasting, deep learning, and data visualization.
